- need to turn on corsE inside firefox because the web is an asshole
- pvss contract is ready. If debugging, hook the Remix instance to Geth using the rpc port
- also need to enable cors inside Geth. The flags are ready in eth-private-net.js
- need the server : fire up http-server -c-1 --cors ./
c=-1 means cache is disabled
- Remix might have to exclude SSL
- Metamask transaction signing operates unexpectedly on private net -> have to manage accounts oneself
